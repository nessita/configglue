Third-party distributions of configglue
=======================================

Many third-party distributors are now providing versions of configglue integrated
with their package-management systems. These can make installation and upgrading
much easier for users of configglue.

Typically, these packages are based on the latest stable release of configglue, so
if you want to use the development version of configglue you'll need to follow the
instructions for :ref:`installing the development version
<installing-development-version>` from Launchpad.

If you're using Linux or a Unix installation, such as OpenSolaris,
check with your distributor to see if they already package configglue. If
you're using a Linux distro and don't know how to find out if a package
is available, then now is a good time to learn.

Currently known distributions that ship configglue are:

  * Ubuntu

    `all Ubuntu releases`_, see also `Ubuntu documentation`_ on "Adding and Removing Software"

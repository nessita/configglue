    If you're new to Python_, you might want to start by getting an idea of what
    the language is like. configglue is 100% Python, so if you've got minimal
    comfort with Python you'll probably get a lot more out of configglue.
    
    If you're new to programming entirely, you might want to start with this
    `list of Python resources for non-programmers`_
    
    If you already know a few other languages and want to get up to speed with
    Python quickly, we recommend `Dive Into Python`_. If that's not quite your
    style, there are quite a few other `books about Python`_.

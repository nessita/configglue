What to read next
=================

So you've read all the :doc:`introductory material </intro/index>` and have
decided you'd like to keep using configglue. We've only just scratched the
surface with this intro.

So what's next?

Well, we've always been big fans of learning by doing. At this point you should
know enough to start fooling around. As you need to learn new tricks, come back
to the documentation.

We've put a lot of effort into making confgglue's documentation useful, easy to
read and as complete as possible. The rest of this document explains more about
how the documentation works so that you can get the most out of it.

How the documentation is organized
==================================

configglue's main documentation is broken up into "chunks" designed to fill
different needs:

    * The :doc:`introductory material </intro/index>` is designed for people new
      to configglue. It doesn't cover anything in depth, but instead gives a
      high-level overview of how developing in configglue "feels".

    * The :doc:`topic guides </topics/index>`, on the other hand, dive deep into
      individual parts of configglue. There are complete guides to configglue's
      :doc:`schema system </topics/schemas>`,
      :doc:`configuration files </topics/config-file>`,
      :doc:`command-line integration </topics/command-line>`, and much more.

      This is probably where you'll want to spend most of your time; if you work
      your way through these guides you should come out knowing pretty much
      everything there is to know about configglue.

    * We've written a set of :doc:`how-to guides </howto/index>` that answer
      common "How do I ...?" questions. Here you'll find information about
      :doc:`writing custom option types </howto/custom-schema-options>`,
      and more.

    * The guides and how-to's don't cover every single class, function, and
      method available in configglue -- that would be overwhelming when you're
      trying to learn. Instead, details about individual classes, functions,
      methods, and modules are kept in the :doc:`reference </ref/index>`. This is
      where you'll turn to find the details of a particular function or
      whathaveyou.

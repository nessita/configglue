===============================================
Porting your apps from configglue 0.11.1 to 1.0
===============================================

.. highlight:: python

configglue 1.0 breaks compatibility with 0.11.1 in some areas.

This guide will help you port 0.11.1 projects and apps to 1.0. The first part of
this document includes the common changes needed to run with 1.0.

.. seealso::

    The :doc:`1.0 release notes </releases/1.0>`. That document explains the new
    features in 1.0 more deeply; the porting guide is more concerned with
    helping you quickly update your code.

Common changes
==============

This section describes the changes between 0.11.1 and 1.0 that most users will
need to make.

Remove ``pyschema`` from the package namespace
----------------------------------------------

All the code in the ``configglue.pyschema`` namespace was moved to the
``configglue`` namespace. Therefore, just rename all your imports that look
like

::

    import configglue.pyschema.schema
    from configglue.pyschema.schema import Schema

to

::

    import configglue.schema
    from configglue.schema import Schema

Rename options
--------------

All option classes called ``<Foo>ConfigOption`` were being deprecated in favour
of the corresponding ``<Foo>Option`` classes. The ``<Foo>ConfigOption``
classes have now been removed, so make sure you rename them to the new names.

The same applies to the ``ConfigOption`` and ``ConfigSection`` classes, which
have been renamed to ``Option`` and ``Section`` respetively.
